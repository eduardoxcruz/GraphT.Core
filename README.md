## Purpose and Real-World Problems Addressed
Its purpose is to empower users with the structure, adaptability, and motivation necessary to organize their tasks and projects in the way that suits them best.

### 1. Complex Task and Project Management
Many real-life projects involve tasks with intricate relationships—dependencies, prerequisites, and parallel flows. Traditional task managers often fail to represent these connections, making it hard to plan, track, and adapt as projects evolve.
GraphT enables users to model tasks as interconnected graphs, reflecting the true complexity of their workflows.

### 2. Adaptable Task Fragmentation
Unlike other frameworks that arbitrarily limit the depth of task fragmentation (e.g., only allowing 3 or 4 levels of subtasks), GraphT empowers users to break down tasks as much—or as little—as they need.
Whether you prefer a simple list or a deeply nested structure with 10+ levels, the system adapts to your personal way of thinking and working, supporting both minimalists and those who need detailed breakdowns.
This flexibility is especially valuable for people with ADHD or executive function difficulties, who may benefit from visualizing and organizing their work in a way that matches their unique cognitive style.

### 3. Automation and Personal Productivity
GraphT integrates productivity techniques such as the Pomodoro method, recurring tasks, and gamification.
These features help users stay focused, build habits, and maintain motivation—addressing common struggles like procrastination, forgetfulness, and difficulty starting or finishing tasks.

### 4. Multi-Platform Support and Scalability
The framework is designed to work across different platforms and to scale from individual use complex project management.
This ensures that users can access and manage their tasks wherever they are, and that the system grows with their needs.

### 5. Centralized and Clear Information
By centralizing task data and providing clear visualization of relationships and progress, GraphT helps users avoid losing context, duplicating effort, or feeling overwhelmed by scattered information.
This is crucial for anyone who struggles with organization or keeping track of multiple projects at once.
