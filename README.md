# GraphT Core

GraphT Core is a project designed for individuals with executive function difficulties or ADHD, providing a flexible, robust, and effective solution for task and project management. The core of the system (GraphT Core) is and will always remain **open-source software**, leaving the final implementation and its customization up to developers, who can adapt it to their needs or integrate it into specific products.

## Purpose and Problems It Solves

GraphT's purpose is to empower individuals with structure, adaptability, and motivation to organize tasks and projects in the way that suits them best.

### 1. Complex Task and Project Management
The project allows tasks to be modeled as interconnected graphs, capturing the real complexity of task relationships (dependencies, parallel flows, etc.). This sets it apart from traditional task managers, which often fail to represent such dynamic connections effectively.

### 2. Adaptable Task Fragmentation
Unlike other tools that limit the depth of task breakdown, GraphT adapts to both minimalistic needs and deeply hierarchical structures, providing effective support for diverse mental approaches.

### 3. Productivity and Automation
GraphT Core includes support for recurring tasks as part of its core functionality, enabling the automation of essential workflows. Other productivity techniques, such as **Pomodoro**, **gamification elements**, and others, are delegated to the final applications built on GraphT, ensuring that each implementation is tailored to the specific needs of the user.

### 4. Scalable and Multi-Platform Support
GraphT is designed to grow with the user's needs, facilitating management from individual projects to more complex initiatives. Since GraphT represents our perspective on productivity at its core, its very design allows for final adaptation to various devices and platforms.

### 5. Centralized Information
GraphT offers clear visualizations of relationships and progress, avoiding scattered information and duplicated efforts, helping those who struggle with organization.

## If You Want to Use GraphT Core

If you want to use GraphT Core for your own user-facing application, the functionalities your application should include, in line with GraphT's perspective and core goals, are the following:

- **Graph Visualization**: A clear and visual representation of task relationships and dependencies.
- **Pomodoro**: Integration of techniques to maintain focus and productivity through effective time blocks.
- **Gamification**: Motivational elements that encourage engagement and goal achievement.

By doing so, you can provide an experience aligned with GraphT's mission, while respecting the modularity of the Core and its fundamental principles.
